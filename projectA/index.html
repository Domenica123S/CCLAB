                <p>The Hydrostonevora falls into the Aquamutidae family. This family reflect the creature's ability to undergo mutations responsive to contact with water</p>

                <p>Hydrostonevora thrives in a sunny and warm habitat carachterised by turqoise water and really yellow sand .</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p> Dr. Evergreen, a distinguished scientist and inrepid explorer, make a groundbreaking discovery after a month long exploring around the island. While exploring for new forms of life , he encountered an adult hydrostonevore, resembling a circular slime created that mantained its shaped until it reached the water where it transformed to a solid squared shape. </p>

                    <li>It loves to eat rocks, and this food gives it the nutrients to grow bigger</li>

                The hydrostonevore, first sighted by Dr. Alexander Evergreen on an unknown Caribbean island, is a unique creature that exhibits color-changing abilities and shape mutations when in contact with water. This species faces threats due to habitat loss, invasive species, and unsustainable biological resource use in the Caribbean Islands Biodiversity Hotspot, where only a small percentage of the original vegetation remains pristine
. The biodiversity of this region is characterized by high species diversity and unique habitats, emphasizing the importance of conservation efforts to protect vulnerable species like the hydrostonevore
                <br>
                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> Humans are marveled at its color-changing abilities and shape-shifting prowess. With gentle guidance, they learned to interact with the creature by pressing arrows to move it left and right, up and down, witnessing its transformation as it touched the water. The hydrostonevore delighted in consuming stones to grow bigger. Together, humans and hydrostonevore found joy in their shared interactions, fostering a harmonious relationship between two worlds.
